# Learn: MERN Stack

## What is MERN?

The **MERN stack** is a popular set of technologies for building full-stack web applications using JavaScript:

- **M** – MongoDB (Database)
- **E** – Express.js (Backend Framework)
- **R** – React.js (Frontend Library)
- **N** – Node.js (Backend Runtime)

The MERN stack allows developers to use JavaScript for both the front-end and back-end, making development efficient and cohesive.

## Key Learning Highlights

### 1. API Testing with Postman

I use **Postman** to test and interact with APIs, especially the backend built with Node.js and Express.js.

### 2. Building the Backend & Connecting to the Frontend

I explored creating the backend from scratch and learned how to connect it with the frontend.

### 3. Understanding MongoDB

I learned about **MongoDB** and how it works as a NoSQL database for storing application data.
